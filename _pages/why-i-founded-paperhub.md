<h2>What is Paperhub?</h2>

Paperhub is a new tool that helps you to supercharge your digital reading experience. With Paperhub you can easily bookmark any web page while browsing with Paperhub's easy-to-use browser extension. Organize your bookmarks in groups with drag-and-drop simplicity and share them with others. If you have bookmarked an article, than you can open it in Paperhub's distractionless reader-mode, which can be customized to your needs. While reading you can highlight important passages.

Highlights are another important part of Paperhub. Create new ones while reading in Paperhub reader or import them from sources such as Amazon Kindle. All your highlights can be imported seamlessy with the integrations you love.

<h2>Why did I found Paperhub?</h2>

As my time as student or professional I have came across many interesting articles, blog posts or papers. I have bookmarked them in my browser, saved them in my Pocket account or highlighted them in my Kindle. But I have never found a tool that combines all these features in one place. That's why I founded Paperhub. I used it for my own needs for a while and eventually decided to bootstrap it into a product and release it to the world of digital readers. If you're one of them, I hope you enjoy Paperhub as much as I do and I'm looking forward to your feedback üôè.
