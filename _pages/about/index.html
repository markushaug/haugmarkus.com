<p>At <a href="https://sap.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SAP</a>, I contribute and lead global enablement strategies impacting over 4.5M+ learners per year, drive developer education, and speak at flagship events worldwide. I’m the co-initiator and product lead of SME Studio, an internal AI platform that accelerates the creation and maintenance of scalable learning content — powering the enablement journey of 2.9M+ active learners annually. See <a href="/my-work-at-sap">my work at SAP</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Outside SAP, I founded <a href="https://mhds.studio" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MHDS Studio</a>, a product studio and boutique tech consultancy. As an experienced global speaker and with <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-87647-9_25" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">published research</a> on deep learning and generative models, I combine academic depth with practical innovation — turning ideas into scalable impact.</p>
