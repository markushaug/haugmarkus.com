At [SAP](https://sap.com/), I contribute and lead global enablement strategies impacting over 4.5M+ learners per year, drive developer education, and speak at flagship events worldwide. I’m the co-initiator and product lead of SME Studio, an internal AI platform that accelerates the creation and maintenance of scalable learning content — powering the enablement journey of 2.9M+ active learners annually. See [my work at SAP](/my-work-at-sap) for more details.

Outside SAP, I founded [MHDS Studio](https://mhds.studio), a product studio and boutique tech consultancy. As an experienced global speaker and with [published research](https://iicser.org/ACR25/). on deep learning and generative models, I combine academic depth with practical innovation — turning ideas into scalable impact.
