As a *Senior Product Learning Specialist* at [SAP](https://sap.com/), I'm an advisor and advocate for the SAP developer community, blending technical expertise, deep product knowledge, and engaging speaking skills to support developers through their learning journeys, overcoming challenges, and achieving SAP certifications worldwide. See [my work at SAP](/my-work-at-sap) for more details.

Academically, I hold a *B.Sc. in Business Informatics*, with a focus on Deep Learning and Business Management, and am currently pursuing an *MSc in Artificial Intelligence* alongside my full-time role. My academic journey included studies in strategic management at [Worcester College (University of Oxford)](https://www.worc.ox.ac.uk/). Recently, I co-authored a Machine Learning research paper accepted at [ACRâ€™25](https://iicser.org/ACR25/).

I am also the founder of [Markus Haug Digital Services](https://mhds.haugmarkus.com), where I innovate at the intersection of technology and business. My latest SaaS venture, [Paperhub](https://paperhub.so), enhances digital reading with features like bookmark organization, distraction-free reading, and highlighting, making it ideal for students, researchers, and knowledge workers.
