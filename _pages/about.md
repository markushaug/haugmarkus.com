As a *Senior Product Learning Specialist* at [SAP](https://sap.com/), I'm a advisor and advocate for the SAP developer community, blending technical expertise, deep product knowledge, and engaging speaking skills to support developers through their learning journeys, overcoming challenges, and achieving SAP certifications worldwide.

My work focuses on developing premier [online content and learning experiences](https://learning.sap.com) for developers of the SAP BTP, specifically within cloud-native application development, leveraging the CAP-framework, SAP Business Application Studio, Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, Kyma, and the intuitive SAP Build platform.

In addition to my professional duties at [SAP](sap.com), I have recently completed my B.Sc. in Business Informatics at the [IU International University of Applied Sciences](https://www.iu.de/bachelor/wirtschaftsinformatik/), specializing in Deep Learning and Business Management. My academic journey also included a unique opportunity to broaden my horizons through an intensive residential academic study abroad programme at [Worcester College (University of Oxford)](https://www.worc.ox.ac.uk/), where I completed courses on strategic management and leadership.

I'm also the founder of [Paperhub](https://paperhub.so), a new tool that helps you to supercharge your digital reading experience.
