As a *Senior Product Learning Specialist* at [SAP](https://sap.com/), I'm a advisor and advocate for the SAP developer community, blending technical expertise, deep product knowledge, and engaging speaking skills to support developers through their learning journeys, overcoming challenges, and achieving SAP certifications worldwide.

My work focuses on developing premier [online content and learning experiences](https://learning.sap.com) for developers of the SAP BTP, specifically within cloud-native application development, leveraging the CAP-framework, SAP Business Application Studio, Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, Kyma, and the intuitive SAP Build platform.

Aside my full-time professional duties at [SAP](sap.com), I'm deepening my expertise through a full-time B.Sc. in Business Informatics at the [IU International University of Applied Sciences](https://www.iu.de/bachelor/wirtschaftsinformatik/), where I specialize in Deep Learning and Business Management. Complementing my studies, I had the unique opportunity through IU to broaden my academic horizon internationally by participating in an intensive residential academic study abroad programme at the [Worcester College (University of Oxford)](https://www.worc.ox.ac.uk/) to study the courses Strategic Management and Leadership.
